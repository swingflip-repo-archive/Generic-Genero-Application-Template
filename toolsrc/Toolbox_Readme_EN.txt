This is a collection of useful toolbox style applications to aid development of your application.
These tools should not be taken and dumped into production as a lot of them exist for demonstration purposes and aren't very efficient. 

When running any of these applications please check the code and make any adjustments if required before blindly running them.
These toolbox apps were also designed to be ran within Genero Studio utilising the Genero Desktop Client. Technically you can 
run them in things like GMA, GMI and GBC but you might as well follow in my footsteps.

Feel free to take apart these tools and improve them to suit your needs. Most of these apps were created from scratch in 5
minutes to aid my development of GGAT.

One application in particular which is somewhat complete is the CreateDatabase application (local_db_sqt_x.4gl)
This contains alls the SQL you need to create a local SQLite3 database to manage the localised data.
